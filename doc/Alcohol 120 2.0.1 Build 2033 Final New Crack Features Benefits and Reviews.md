## Benefits of Alcohol 120%
 
Alcohol 120% is not only a useful tool for creating and burning backups of your discs, but also for enjoying some of the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption. According to some studies, drinking alcohol in moderation may have some positive effects on your health, such as:

- Reducing your risk of developing and dying of heart disease by increasing your levels of good cholesterol (HDL) and preventing blood clots[^2^]
- Possibly reducing your risk of ischemic stroke, which occurs when the arteries to your brain become narrowed or blocked[^2^]
- Possibly reducing your risk of type 2 diabetes by improving your insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism[^2^]
- Possibly preventing the formation of gallstones by stimulating the flow of bile and reducing cholesterol levels in the gallbladder[^2^]

Of course, these benefits are not guaranteed and may vary depending on your individual factors, such as your age, gender, genetics, lifestyle, and medical history. Moreover, drinking too much alcohol can have harmful effects on your health, such as:

- Increasing your risk of some cancers, especially those of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, breast, and colon[^1^]
- Causing liver damage and inflammation, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure[^1^]
- Increasing your blood pressure and weakening your heart muscle, which can lead to heart failure and stroke[^1^]
- Affecting your brain function and mood, which can lead to depression, anxiety, memory loss, and dementia[^1^]
- Interfering with your judgment and coordination, which can increase the risk of accidents and injuries[^1^]
- Causing birth defects and developmental problems in unborn children if consumed during pregnancy[^1^]

Therefore, it is important to drink alcohol responsibly and within the recommended limits. The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans define moderate alcohol consumption as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men[^3^]. One drink is equivalent to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (such as vodka or whiskey)[^3^]. However, these guidelines may not apply to everyone, especially if you have a history of alcohol abuse or addiction, a family history of alcoholism, a medical condition that can be worsened by alcohol, or if you take medications that interact with alcohol. In these cases, you should consult your doctor before drinking any alcohol.
